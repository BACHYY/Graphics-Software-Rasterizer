# 3D Graphics Rendering Engine 
• Developed a sophisticated 3D graphics rendering engine in C++ from scratch, incorporating model loading, 3D transformations, camera systems, and rasterization, capable of parsing OBJ files and rendering complex 3D models to produce output in PPM format with accurate depth and perspective.

• Implemented core graphics primitives such as vectors, matrices, colors, and triangles, designed and implemented 2D and 3D triangle rasterization algorithms using Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) and barycentric coordinates, and created a depth buffer system for accurate object occlusion in 3D space.

• Optimized rendering performance through back-face culling, utilized object-oriented programming principles to establish a modular and extensible graphics library, and demonstrated advanced proficiency in linear algebra and computer graphics theory with techniques like perspective projection and viewport transformations, with a rendering time of 75ms per frame.
